title: On making decisions

Thoughts:
  - what are the steps by which decisions are made
    - minimum level of substantiation
    - one/two max accountable individuals for a particular decision
    - steps:
      - proposals with substantiation
      - voting / discussion (audience differing)
      - accountable individual makes decision to go forward or not
      - trial period / MVP implementation
      - more feedback
      - production/full process implementation
  - what are the steps by which this process is updated?
    - steps:
      - proposals
      - votes
      - trial period
      - revoting
      - formalization and incorporation into the process
