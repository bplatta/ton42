Notes:
  - Teams have four features:
    - joint tasks to fulfil a compelling mission
    - clear boundaries in terms of information flow,
      alignment with other organisational units, resources or decision-making policies;
    - authority to self-manage within these boundaries
    - stability over some reasonable period of time.
  - On determining authority:
    - who is in best positions to handle the above?
    - setting directions for the team. What is the objectives? Core mission or purpose?
    - designing the performing unit
      - how will tasks be structured?
      - how will you determine who performs them?
      - norms of behavior
      - how do people get resources that they need?
    - monitoring and managing the process
      - what data do you need to collect?
      - what determines success and the need for path correction?
    - executing the work - physical or mental energy
  - different types:
    - manager-led (naaaa)
    - self-managing - organisational context and overall direction provided by management
    - self-designing - management only responsible for overall direction
    - self-governing - responsibility for all functions. From direction to execution
  - self organizing is the rule/law
  - self organizing is an ongoing process
  - process:
    - daily standup - sync up, talk about blockers, questions
    - retrospectives
    - process reviews
  - conditions for coherency:
    - a containing boundary - defines its identity. clear cut mission,
      compelling direction and challenging goals
    - significant differences - difference in knowledge, experience, education, age,
      gender, cultural background. Incorporate diversity.
    - Transforming exchange - guiding team both within the team and with its
      environment.
  - contextual support:
    - information - in terms of providing the data that members need to competently plan
      and execute
    - infrastructure - appropriate physical space, technical infra and money
    - education - training, coaching or technical assistance
    - reward - positive, economic as well as symbolic consequences for good
      team performance
