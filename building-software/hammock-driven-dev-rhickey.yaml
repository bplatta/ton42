Notes:
  - Fix bugs in dev. yes. of course. AND IN DESIGN
  - Analysis & Design - what is the problem? Does this design solve this problem
  - Dont build features! Solve problems! Feature is not purpose. Do NOT introduce new problems
  - Avoiding problems is NOT solving them!
  - wikihow, how to solve it
  - how
    - STATE THE PROBLEM!
      - say it out loud
      - write it down
    - UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM!
      - facts
      - constraints
      - context
      - you will know some things you dont know
      - there are some things you wont know you dont know...
      - related problems? who solved this before?
      - write it down
    - BE DISCERNING!
      - focus on own stuff. not everything is awesome...
      - problems in your solutions?
        - solve those too
      - what are the tradeoffs?
      - questions?
        - find out what you dont know
      - read in and around your space, papers etc.
      - find other persons solution, crucify it, be critical
    - TRADEOFFS
      - enumerate 2 or more possible solutions
        - whats good or bad about them?
      - write it down
    - MAINTAINING FOCUS
      - computer is prime source of distraction
        - (Note - i should spend minimum 30min a day with notepad sitting isolated somewhere. with a pencil of course)
      - WAKING MIND
        - good at critical thinking
        - analysis & tactics
        - prone to finding local maxima
        - use waking mind time to feed work to the background mind
          -  analyze its products
      - BACKGROUND MIND
        - sleeping mind is instance of it
        - good at making connections
          - synthesis
          - strategy
          - abstracts, analogizes
        - solver of most non-trivial problems
          - scientific american said it!
          - brain is processing info while we sleep! yay!
          - solves problems we were working on
        - HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEM DURING THE DAY!
          - make it an agenda item for the mind while your asleep
    - LOADING IT UP
      - 7 +/- 2 working memory limit
      - Many designs > 9 components!
      - write proposed solution down
        - pictures!
        - this will help you survey it
      - Go over go over
      - THEN. STOP. CLOSE EYES. MINDS EYE WILL WANDER. DONT TRY. JUST. DONT.
    - WAAAAIIT FOR IT
      - CAKE IS IN THE OVEN
      - wait overnight... we'll see
      - sleep sober
      - sometimes... take... months
      - work on 1 thing a day (if you can)
    - EVENTUALLY CODING IS REQUIRED
      - TYPE SPARINGLY!!!!!
      - feedback loop is important
      - dont lean on this though
    - YOU WILL BE WRONG!
      - when the facts change, rerun the experiment!
