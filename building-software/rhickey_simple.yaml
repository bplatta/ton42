Notes:
    - Dikstra:simplicity is a prereq for reliability
    - simple:
      - one role
      - one task
      - one concept
      - one dimension
      - don't confuse 'one' with cardinality
      - object
    - easy:
      - near by
      - near to understanding
      - relative
    - construct vs artifact
      - should care more about the artifact
      - not the tools
      - programmer convenience can be BAD
