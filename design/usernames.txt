title: On the usage of usernames for logins

source: http://venturebeat.com/2016/04/02/we-need-a-new-username-system/

thoughts:
  - This article's point is essentially that its bogus that usernames are
    doled out on a first come first serve basis. Is it truly fair?
  - I don't particularly care for the article's main point

  on usernames:
    - uniquely identify users by email and allow them to choose any display name
      which can be non unique
    - Indicate clearly users that have not been 'verified'. Need a robust ID system
    - encourage users to de-anonymize
