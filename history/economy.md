### 1944
- The Bretton Woods Aggreement established that currencies should be backed by gold and that USD would be the reserve currency.This was an agreement between the countries of the UN at the time. [cite](citation.md#brenton-woods). It also established the International Monetary Fund. The declared goal of the IMF is mainly to maintain global economic stability. It does this by facilitating trade, promoting employment, reducing poverty etc. [cite](citation.md#imf). It wasn't fully operational until 1958. US was committed to backing every dollar with gold.

### 1971
- Nixon indefinitely suspends the convertibility of USD to gold per the Bretton Woods Agreement. By 1973, as reforms to the Bretton Woods agreement proved impossible. The De Facto standard became floating fiat currencies. Why did he do this? The money supply had increased to such a level that the US just didnt have enough gold in the reserve to cover it. I mean they were off by quite a bit. Only 3.2 billion for foreign assets after taking into account domestic assets. And foreign assets totaled like 14 billion.  Vietnam War was also very constly. Countries started pulling out of the agreement and Congress suggested devaluing the dollar. So Nixon suspended convertibility, froze wages and prices for 90 days, and added import tax so other countries didn't take advantage of the week dollar.

### 1974
- [OPEC](organizations.md#opec) places embargo on US for military aid to the Israelies. SO Nixon administration barters a deal with Saudi Arabia. In exchange for purchasing oil from Saudi Arabia, they have to pour money into US, financing US debt. This was all hidden too. Only a recent (2016) FOID has brought it to light. There was also an agreement that Saudi oil could only be purchased with USD. Which created a strong demand for USD. Surplus OPEC dollars actually ended up in US and London banks.
