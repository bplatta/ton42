# History

I'm bad at remembering. This should help. Also, it'll be easier to point at what 'facts' I know and revise them as I learn more.

## Some conventions
- I'm putting citations in `citation.md` and linking to anchors in markdown
- I plan on adding conceptual structure as I go along and as it occurs to me. ie. How I decide to map my understanding to what would essentially be a file system structure. I will add more complex interactions between files as I see fit
