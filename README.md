So I figured I'd version control some of my thoughts. I've the had goal of writing
regularly weighing over me for some time and I failed multiple times in
developing a habit of it. This should at least decrease the cost of the habit
as its such a short step from my typical daily behavior. Also testing out certain mental 
compartmentalizations here. It also makes it very
easy to say 'hey, take a look at this thought and add comments/thoughts/critiques.'
Which sounds lovely in theory. 

#### what
- research is any research writeups I'm working on.
- articles are articles I've read. These will be a little
  less structured. Notes + Musings -> some sort of conclusion. Or no conclusion. We'll see.
