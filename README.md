So I figured I'd version control some of my thoughts. I've the had goal of writing
regularly weighing over me for some time and I failed multple times in
developing a habit of it. This should at least decrease the cost of the habit
as its such a short step from my typical daily behavior. It also makes it very
easy to say 'hey, take a look at this and add comments/thoughts/critiques.'
Which sounds lovely in theory.

#### what
- books are books I've read. The goal here is to actually
  force myself to boil down what I read with the hope of this
  increasing retention and understanding
- articles are articles I've read. These will be a little
  less structured. Notes + Musings -> some sort of conclusion. Or no conclusion. We'll see.
- phil includes my own philosophical ramblings and anything I've read.

#### Current TODO:
- building-software/agile_manifesto
- building-software/continuous_deployment
- books/lanier_who_owns_the_future
