So I figured I'd version control some of my thoughts. I've the had goal of writing
regularly weighing over me for some time and I failed multiple times in
developing a habit of it. This should at least decrease the cost of the habit
as its such a short step from my typical daily behavior. Also testing out certain mental 
compartmentalizations here. It also makes it very
easy to say 'hey, take a look at this thought and add comments/thoughts/critiques.'
Which sounds lovely in theory. 

#### Disclaimer
Although I might be needlessly subjecting the world to my idiocy, I assume you are here by your own volition
and so I don't expect many complaints on that front. And to be clear, this doesn't exist for the purpose of 
exposure or web traffic. I certainly don't want to contribute to the endless pile that exists in cyberspace today.
If you find some of my thoughts irresponsible or find yourself responding emotionally in some such way, shoot me a comment and I'll try parsing and incorporating the feedback!

#### what
- research is any research writeups I'm working on.
- articles are articles I've read. These will be a little
  less structured. Notes + Musings -> some sort of conclusion. Or no conclusion. We'll see.

To-Do:
- articles/is-competition-always-good
- thoughts: On current tech. On negative externalities + locuses.
