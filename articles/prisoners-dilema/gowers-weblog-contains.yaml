Notes:
  - Context on author
    - For the brexit. Academic w/ french wife and bilingual children
    - Article is 'back to first principles'
  - Layout for article. Addressing 3 questions:
      - need for supranational organizations
      - to what extent we should care about sovereignty
      - whether we should focus on the national interest
  - Case for supranational organizations:
    - Seems to take it as a given, 'so it can benefit nations to join groups 
      and agree to restrict their behaviour in certain ways.'
    - Example illustration, issues with drugs in sports
      - one argument is to just allow drugs. However this has the affect of making them
        compulsory
      - Athletes taking drugs have an edge. But it has been found that these drugs have some
        serious health side effects. ie. its not in their best interest in the long run
      - Simply agreeing on not takig drugs not enough. Need an organization to which they
        belong that conducts regular screenings and punishes drug usage.
      - the reveal, its the Prisoner's Dilema (PD)!!
    - Of course, actors in the PD need not be people, they can be countries
      - Example, a government imposed minimum wage.
        - Not having one makes companies more competitive arguably, with lower prices. Possible
          its a net benefit to the economy
        - Might benefit a nation to become the 'sweatshop of europe'
        - Without an organization enforcing any rules against this, all countries will be aware of this strategy
          and likely be inclined to choose it, making all workers worse off and destroying the competitive advantage
      - Another example is of course, Climate Change (very true)
      - Another example is corporation tax
        - Lowering the tax would attract foreign investment -> race to the bottom!
  - Should we care about sovereignty?:
    - He argues it begs the question as to what layer of granularity one might WANT sovereignty
      - Should it be at the national level? city level? county? Perhaps family level?
      - He works backwards from the 'lowest' level
        - Families benefit from decisions at a higher level -> county? etc.etc.
        - Of course, lower level units have less control over that higher level entity -> low accountability
    - 'Principle of  Subsidiarity' - principle that decisions should be taken at the lowest level that is appropriate
      - Personal aside: 
        - For this to work effectively I would imagine would require an assessment of the externalities of a given decisions
          in addition to the direct consequences of it. Externalities are notoriously difficult to assess and codify into law.
      - He argues that it is Subsidiarity that REALLY matters
  - To what extent does the natural interest matter:
    - Of course! All things being equal! (are they?)
    - Suppose it was in UKs best interest to leave EU. Is it in Europes? Suppose it wasnt. Should one vote to leave?
      - utilitarian - total benefit of UK leaving EU = benefit to UK - benefit to EU. So. No
      - Are we all really strict utilitarians? Suspect no. Author isn't selling his house at his detriment to do more good etc.
    - Author's principle (pretty sensible in my opinion) - 'some people I care about more than others (interests are 
      wrapped up together). Give more weight to people/groups closer to me'
      - once weighting taking into account, basically utilitarian.
      - maximize total utility given the weights
    - So. who do I feel closer to? And what are those weights? How does it affect the equation?
    - Aside:
        - motivated by comment. Can you formalize the latter relationships and weights with a graph?

Reaction:
  - Ultimately I certainly agree that organizations that exist at higher levels and govern decisions that have
    externalities that cross boundaries need to exist. Precisely for prisoner dilema situations. Or even situations
    in which one group would be disadvatanged or at the behest of a more powerful group's decision.
  - The lines drawn to dileneate groups on geographical lines are subject to varying degrees of 
    arbitrarity and it would be ideal if these could have some fluidity. (this would of course require an 
    abstraction one layer above). Say within national lines, or in the US, within state lines.
  - I wonder to what extent that utility equation could be formalized. Or even an estimate
    - Could you crowdsource the features in this equation?
      - Crowdsourcing an optimization equation? Would people be afraid of the math? Hide it. Show it if called for.
        - Is a heuristic of just voting a better way to aggregate preferences? Should modeling even be undertaken at this level?
          - question is whether voting systems regularily reach the 'ideal' solution within a margin of error
