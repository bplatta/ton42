#### why do I have a whole directory on the prisoners dilema?
- I'm always curious about the game theoretic codification of real life
- I think there are numerous cases of the prisoners dilema in real life
- I'm curious about system design such that those suboptimal equilibriums are avoided
- tl;dr: I'm looking for patterns in how this dilema manifests itself in the real world etc. etc.
