Notes:
  - plotted total monthly crime and overlayed trendlines for the year
  - assessed crime by breaking down into different time scales
    - crime by day of week
    - hour of day
    - most active days per year
  - does some basic theorizing of means and modes etc
  - question? Is data artifact of how it was reported, or gathered? Or actually representative?
  - looking at different time/data series is great way to build familiarity with dataset
