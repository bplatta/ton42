title: On AI and the future of civilization with Stephen Wolfram

Notes:
  - What will the world be like when everyone can write code?
    - analogous to when the modern world became literate
  - some concepts can be expressed more cleanly in code
    - natural language becomes burdensome when discussing lofty concepts.
      - requires someone with a real grasp of the language and a vast lexicon to
        articulate more sophisticated notions
      - SW envisions contracts being entirely codified. Can I do this according to this contract?
        is a question that can be asked of the program which spits out a bool.
  - the evolution of human purposes over time
    - how do i get food? feed my family? survive?
    - now? walk on a treadmill?! WHAT?!
    - what influences our purposes, the quotidian and the quixotic
    - They are often an optimization of time. What happens when you can accomplish things
      much quicker?
  - some history on neural networks
    - MucCulloch and Pitts in 1943
    - marvin minsky and seymour Papert wrote a proof that perceptrons can
      only make linear distinctions between things. ie. they were boring. So no one
      cared about NN for a while
      ai
  - first thought on making computational knowledge system
    - build brain like thing, feed it knowledge (like standard education)
  - other way around kind of. inspiration - cellular atomata, turing machines
  - take simple programs and look at how they combine with eachother
    - mine technology out of the computational universe
      - similar to real mining!
      - go out and find something with particularly interesting properties
      - how do we connect these properties to something with a human purpose, goal?
      - this searching can provide the basic bits for creativity, where from there
        a human can compose something
  - Can you encapsulate the knowledge that we've accumulated,
    both in science and in the collection of data in the world, into a
    language which we can use to communicate with computers?
  - How do you distinguish purpose from patterns?
  - How do you distinguish purpose from computation?
  - SW - the history of a thing. (my caveot - a history we've CHOSEN to care about)
