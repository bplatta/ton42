Notes:
    - conceptual complexity / complexity of ideas
     - as applied to meta-mathematics (dealing with incompleteness and limits of pure thought)
    - Herman Weyl 1185 - 1955
        - mathematician and physicist
        - phil of sci - complexity is essential in understanding the notion 'law of nature'
            - if they can be arbitrarily complext - become vacuous

        - Laws of nature MUST be simple
        - How do you measure the complexity of an equation? Wants to formalize the notion of complexity
    - Leibniz!
        - 1686 Discours de métaphysique para V and VI (V - "world IS compreshensible", who knew. Leibniz knew)
        - what does 'obeying a law' mean?
            - mathematic formulation (i.e. some equation exists...) -> No! does not distinguius from random
            - equation must be siiiiimple
        - the world is comprehensible - simple laws produce the richness of the world
    - Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT)
        - input (program) -> Computer -> output (experimental data) where Computer is fixed universal Turing machine
        - both input and output are merely finite sequences of bits
        - no distinction between input data and methods/tools used
        - theory as input, internal signal -> calculating .... -> data? yes! - theory explains, no!! - theory should be tossed
        - explanation as a form of compression
        - Turing machine subject ot the halting problem (will it finish?!)
            - new formulation of halting problem. Given string of bits S. is it possible to prove that S is irreducible
                - Given S, is it possible to prove that there exists no program P smaller than S that generates S
            - No proof possible! (incompleteness result, Godel)
            - program P is elegant if no program smaller than P produces the same output as P
                - can you prove a program is elegant? super harrrrd
                - incompleteness result, corollary: unsolvability of Turing Halting Problem

            This guys proof that you can't prove a program elegant (~e):
                taken: theory A. clear grammar and finite set of axioms.
                you can (David Hilbert): deduce all possible proofs from the set of axioms for A
                consider: program P s.t. P(x) (output of P) is of the first provably elegant program Q larger than P
                    P only cares about theorems that prove individual programs Q are elegant. P Chugs along computing all proofs
                    from A until it finds a proof that ~e program Q is larger than P itself. P then runs Q, remembers its output,
                    and then genreates same output as Q.
                    -> Thats impossible! by the definition of elegance. P is smaller than Q. and Q is an elegant program.
                    -> P never finds Q. FATAL

    - Gives us a way to measure conceptual complexity of format theory A
        - number of bits in a program tha does this (compute all possible derivations of A's axioms)
        - in theory A, can't prove any program elegant that is larger ins size than A's complexity
    - With Godels approach, can't tell if incompleteness is ubiquitous, commonplace or restricted to degenerate cases
        - with notion complexity you get a little more: its pervasive
        - AIT makes incompleteness look natural**
    - Halting probability Ω - prob that a comp program chosen at random will halt
        - if K bit program halts, contributes 1/2^K to halting probability
        - Ω = sum all programs that halt (2^-abs(p)) (p - p's size in bits)  (infinite sum diverges!)
        - programs are self-delimiting. no extension of program is valid.
        - Convergence of sum is SLOOW.
        - Ω is transcendental real number.
            - irreducible
            - smallest program that calcuates first N of bits of base-2 expansion of Ω will also have N bits!
    - Principle of sufficient reason (Leibniz)
        - if something is true, it is true for a reason (he says. GOD!)
    - Necessary truths (with reason) and contingent truths (e.g. whose the president?)
        - latter cannot be proved mathematically or logically (its historical)
    - Ω shows pure mathematics is infinitely complex!
    - Reaction to incompleteness
        - ignored kinda
        - Is the uncertainty in physics so different from that of pure math?
        - can only approach absolute trith asymptotically
