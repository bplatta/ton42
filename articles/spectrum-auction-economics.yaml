application: US auction of national radio spectrum

Notes:
  - right to use radio band governed by the FCC(Fed Comm Commission)
  - For decades, Fed parceled out radio divisions by conducting hearings and lotteries
  - started selling spectrum in 1994. (US Treasury 100 billion richer as a result!)
  - George von Lengerke Meyer, Taft's Secrectary of the navy, was frustrated by amateurs
    jamming navy frequencies and causing interference
  - in the aftermath of 1912 Titanic, people blamed amateur radio operators for 
    muddying up the rescue operation -> spurred Congress to pass the Radio Act
  - Radio Act - required all broadcasters to obtain licenses from the Secrectary of Commerce
    - By 1927, spectrum was a publically owned and managed resource
  - next 55 yrs, method of choice was 'comparitive hearings' - panel in from of the FedRadioCommission (now FCC)
    - licenses given out for free essentially
    - given to whomever best advanced the 'public interest' - which led to a lot of lawsuits from the losers
  - With the advent of TV, license applications were plentiful
    - Congress approved a lottery system in 1983
    - The lottery system proved problematic. Not basing the decision on ANYTHING was an issue
    - People were like, 'wtf, just giving away huge assets here randomly?'
  - in 1993, Congress called for FCC to issue licenses by auction
  - spectrum a little more complicated to auction off
    - value of a given license for a bidder often depends on the value of other licenses
    - how much should company bid for, say, California, if they are going for a national network? well depends on what other licenses they can get
      - needs to know how much the other states will cost
      - what if some other company knows this strategy and just puts all chips on NY to hold out for an absurd priceonomics
    - 'Exposure Problem' - people can react to your strategy knowingly. Asymetric information
    - the Challenge -  set up an auction in which multiple bidders could bid on multiple licenses in
      multiple markets without running into the exposure problem
  - Solution - simultaneous setting of prices
    - Round 1 - all bidders bid on desired markets
    - Round 2 - review high bids. Update strategy. Another round of bidding
    - auction finally ends when a round passes in which no bids are made on any of the licenses.
  - First auction held in July of 1994
  - Problems
    - can collude by conveying strategy in bid prices
    - Comcast and TWC exploited a quirk that made it more difficult for bidders to move from
      on license to the other (quirk here, http://web.stanford.edu/~jdlevin/Papers/AWS.pdf)
  - Coming issues
    - the supply is fixed! (kinda) 2012 FCC initiated a plan to repurpose spectrum. Quite the resource
      reallocation
    - New design
      - FCC is lone BUYER in a reverse auction, FCC starts high and sought out TV broadcasters willing to sell at low prices
      - FCC is merely playing the middleman in spectrum recycling
      - Finishing with forward auction
        - bids are not tied to specific frequency, made for generic spectrum in a region
        - doesnt depend on bids. instead, FCC raises price at each step and asks bidders how much they will by at price
