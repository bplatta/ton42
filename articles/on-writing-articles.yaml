Notes:
	- write your second paragraph first. This will lay out what the essay says
  - four types of discursive writing
    - argument - convinces someone of something
      - to take an action, that something is the case, that this conclusion is the right one
      - premises to a conclusion
    - explanation - tells why something happened instead of something else
      - why something is the case
      - identify thing being explained
      - identify things that could have happend instead
      - describe conditions and principles that led to the one thing and not others
    - definition - states what a word or concept means
      - can do so using words or concepts you already know
      - can do so indirectly by telling stories or showing examples
      - 2 parts
        - word or concept being defined
        - set of sentences or propositions doing the defining
    - description - identifies properties or qualities of things
  - organizing writing
    - can be chronological
    - enumerate set of properties
    - elements of a list
    - may cover the 5 w's
  - first paragraph is used to animate article. Give it life! Give it meaning and context
  - after getting through first part of article, provide an anecdote or illustration to drive the point home
  - Indicator words
    - each type has their own indicator words
    - premise indicators - because, since
      - when premises need to be stressed before the conclusion will be believed, conclusion is put at the end
        of the paragraph
    - Arguments
      -  can also be identified by their form
        - inductive - base case, examples, therefore, statistical generalization etc.
        - deductive - categorical (reasoning about sets), propositional (using if, or, and etc.)
    - Explanations
      - can sound like arguments. Typically answers to 'why' questions
      - say something was 'caused' by something else
      - can also appeal to statistical explanation
    - Definitions
      - ostensive - naming by pointing
      - lexical - defintion in terms of other words or concepts. providing the necessary and sufficient conditions
      - implicit - list instances of the thing being defined
    - Description
      - subject predicate object
        - subject is thing being described
        - predicate is something that is true about the subject
        - object may be some other entity that forms a part of the description
  - Complex forms
    - These can be combined
    - for example, an argument might have 2 premises that are themselves definitional or an explanation
