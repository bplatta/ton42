title: American Democracy is Doomed

Notes:
  - Since George W. Bush administration, people have been claiming the government
	  seemed to be acting like a dictatorship
    - people thought similarly with Obama moves on immigration etc.
  - its on faith that when right and left talk like this, they're just wrong
  - common to think solution is one election away
  Some History:
    - after 2 world war, Germany, Austria, Japan and Italy were given 
      constitutions written by local leaders in collaboration with occupying authorities
      - None were pushed towards a system like the US political system
      - why? disputed. American style systems much more common in western hemisphere
        and parliamentary are common elsewhere
      - Juan Linz on why prez systems prone to crisis
        - nature of checks and balances. Both Congress and Pres came claim to speak for the people,
          "There is no democratic principle on the basis of which it can be resolved"
          - No mechanisms in the consistution to really solve this gridlock situation
        - In parliamentay systems, deadlocks get resolved. If PM doesnt have majority support
          in parliament, new one is elected that does. If majority cant be found, new parliament
          is elected until one is. deadlocks can last weeks, but not years
    - For much of american history, political parties have been un-disciplined and un-idealogical
      - they are named after vague ideas rather than governed by particular idealogies
    - On American polarization
      - more polarized, but some say this isnt necessarily cause for alarm
        - the real exception, is when parties WERENT polarized. in the middle of the 20th century
        - polarization is the norm
      - measured by system DW-NOMINATE
      - this march to high polarization is actually a return to former party polarization in early 20th century
      - why the drop mid-century? Race! (well at least that was one factor)
        - democratic party included northern liberals and southern conservatives that supported segregation
      - so this is a return to the norm and its FINE
    - what this is missing is focus on idealogy! DW-NOMINATE extended to include people who arent elected officials
      - for writers and political pundits
      - found that gilded age members, while they voted in a highly partisan way, 
        their voting didn't reflect any polarization of ideas evident in broader American society
      - back then, it was mostly about protecting patronage rights! ha
    - the rise of proggressive and liberal idealogy and conservative to counter in 1920s,1930s,1940s upended this system
      - in 1970 it was common to claim parties were in decline
        - Martin Wattenberg's "The Decline of Political Parties in America"
          - waning influence of party proffessionals, rise of single-  issue groups, attendant fall in voter turnout
        - Same Rosenfeld - but 'under the hood' changes in process for selecting presedential nominees ad congressional leaders
          created receptive system for issue-based activism
      - that is, todays Polarization NOT the same
  - Example of system breaking down - Honduras in 2008
    - President Zelaya tried to change consitution by plebiscite
      - ruling that ballot was unconsistutional
      - he ordered military to distribute ballot, they refused, he fired top dogs
      - military deposed prez in coup. No legal way to impeach the president
  - In this system, president is held responsible by the public even though many
    things are outside of his control
    - in parliamentary system, head of gov that believes nation needs action legislature
      cant approve, can dissolve parliament and hold new election to decide on issue
  - Constitutional hardball has become common place
    - filibustering was considered a borderline unconsistitutional recourse in 2004 and not its use is commonplace
    - Cloture votes (to break filibusters) has spiked in the recent years
    - Even used the debt-ceiling and impending defaulting on debt to argue for policy changes!
  - Congress approval all time low
  - Pres (Obama) circumventing congress
    - Bush 'no kid left behind' program had targets for states to hit or risk penalties
      - laws authors thought when law came up for reauth, the targets would be adjusted. but nothing happens in congress
        so sec of education (executive branch of course) is issuing waivers on conditions 
        of state education policy changes ordered by department of education
      - unprecedenteed in display of executive policy making
  - In the current climate, any elected official is expected to further the agenda of his party, which
    expect to see thier policies enacted
  - office of the president is uber important with a gridlocked congress and the scope of executive power
  - what would happen with something like the Bush v Gore vote in the current climate?
  - shits wack
